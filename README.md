### Is Using GoofCord Risky Business? ü§î
- While using GoofCord goes against [Discord ToS](https://discord.com/terms#software-in-discord%E2%80%99s-services), rest assured that no one has ever been banned from using it or any client mods.    
GoofCord also does some clever tricks to make Discord think you are just using a web client. 

### How can I access the settings? ‚öôÔ∏è
- Multiple ways:
  - Right-click on the tray icon and click `Open Settings`
  - Open Discord settings, and you should see the top most button in the category "GoofCord", click it, and the settings will pop out for you. 
  - Press `Ctrl+Shift+'` shortcut.

### Seeking the Source Code? üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- You can find our source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Milkshiift/GoofCord/).
  
### What's the difference between ArmCord and GoofCord? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- ArmCord and GoofCord share an origin, but now, GoofCord has evolved into a distinct client. It has its own unique philosophy, plans, and features, setting it apart as a separate client. You may have expected a comparison list, but it would be really, really pointless.
