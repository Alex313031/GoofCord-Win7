**GoofCord is a Discord client based on the open-source [ArmCord](https://github.com/ArmCord/ArmCord) client.**

GoofCord aims to be even more lightweight and privacy-focused than ArmCord, but it achieves this by sacrificing some of ArmCord's features.

Better readme will be later.

## Acknowledgements

GoofCord is based on the [ArmCord](https://github.com/ArmCord/ArmCord) client, which was created by the ArmCord team.
