- Multiple ways:
  - Right-click on the tray icon and click `Open Settings`
  - Open Discord settings, and you should see the top most button in the category "GoofCord," click it, and the settings will pop out for you. 
  - Press `Ctrl+Shift+'` shortcut.

### Seeking the Source Code? üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- You can find our source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Milkshiift/GoofCord/).
  
### What's the difference between ArmCord and GoofCord? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- GoofCord takes the minimalist approach, intentionally shedding features that most users find non-essential. Our top priority is guarding your privacy, though there may not be much to improve. Additionally, it stands out with its distinct plans and philosophy.
